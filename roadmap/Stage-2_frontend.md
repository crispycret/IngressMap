# Stage 2: Frontend Development

## Next Steps

### 1. User Interface Design
- **Wireframe the Application**: Create wireframes for the main components of the application, including:
  - Ingress recording form
  - File upload section
  - Map visualization area
- **Choose a UI Library**: Decide on a UI component library (e.g., Material-UI, Ant Design) to enhance the design.

### 2. Implement Ingress Recording Form
- **Create Form Component**: Develop a React component for the ingress recording form.
  - Fields to include: 
    - Customer Name
    - Address
    - Ingress Level
    - Frequency Range
    - Additional Notes
- **Form Validation**: Implement client-side validation to ensure all required fields are filled out correctly.

### 3. File Upload Functionality
- **Create File Upload Component**: Develop a component to handle file uploads from the Viavi ONX 650 meter.
- **Integrate File Handling**: Use libraries like `react-dropzone` or `react-file-upload` to manage file uploads.
- **Preview Uploaded Files**: Provide a preview or confirmation of the uploaded file before submission.

### 4. State Management
- **Choose State Management Solution**: Decide on a state management approach (e.g., React Context API, Redux).
- **Implement State Management**: Set up state management to handle form data and uploaded files.

### 5. API Integration
- **Set Up Axios or Fetch**: Install and configure Axios or use the Fetch API to handle HTTP requests.
- **Create API Service**: Develop a service to manage API calls for submitting ingress data and uploading files.
- **Connect Form to API**: Ensure the form submission sends data to the backend API.

### 6. Map Visualization
- **Choose Mapping Library**: Decide on a mapping library (e.g., Leaflet.js, Google Maps API).
- **Set Up Map Component**: Create a React component to display the map.
- **Integrate Map with API**: Fetch and display ingress data on the map based on user submissions.

### 7. Testing
- **Unit Testing**: Write unit tests for the form and file upload components using testing libraries like Jest and React Testing Library.
- **Integration Testing**: Test the integration between the frontend and backend to ensure data flows correctly.

### 8. Documentation
- **Update README.md**: Document the progress made in Stage 2, including any new features and how to use them.
- **Create STAGE_2.md**: Document the steps taken during Stage 2 for future reference.

## Conclusion
Completing these steps will establish the core functionality of the frontend, allowing users to record ingress readings and upload files, setting the stage for backend integration and map visualization in the next stage.
