# Stage 4: Map Integration

## Next Steps

### 1. Choose Mapping Library
- **Select Mapping Library**: Confirm the choice of mapping library (e.g., Leaflet.js or Google Maps API) for visualizing ingress data.

### 2. Set Up Map Component
- **Create Map Component**: Develop a React component to display the map.
- **Integrate Mapping Library**: Install and configure the chosen mapping library within the React application.

### 3. Fetch Ingress Data
- **API Integration**: Create a service to fetch ingress data from the backend API.
- **Display Data on Map**: Plot ingress data points on the map using markers, showing relevant information (e.g., ingress level, address).

### 4. Implement Filtering Options
- **Create Filter Controls**: Develop UI controls (e.g., dropdowns, sliders) to filter ingress data based on severity and frequency range.
- **Update Map Based on Filters**: Implement functionality to update the displayed data on the map based on user-selected filters.

### 5. User Interaction
- **Add Click Events**: Implement click events on map markers to display detailed information about each ingress record.
- **Enable Zoom and Pan**: Ensure users can zoom in/out and pan around the map for better navigation.

### 6. Testing the Map Functionality
- **Test Map Integration**: Verify that the map displays correctly and that data points are accurately represented.
- **User Testing**: Conduct user testing to gather feedback on the map's usability and functionality.

### 7. Documentation
- **Update README.md**: Document the progress made in Stage 4, including how to use the map features.
- **Create STAGE_4.md**: Document the steps taken during Stage 4 for future reference.

## Conclusion
Completing these steps will integrate the mapping functionality into the Ingress Monitoring System, allowing users to visualize ingress data effectively and interact with it based on various filters.
