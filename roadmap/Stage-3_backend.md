# Stage 3: Backend Development

## Next Steps

### 1. Set Up Backend Framework
- **Choose Framework**: Confirm the choice of Python framework (Flask or Django) for the backend.
- **Create Project Structure**: Organize the project structure for the backend, including directories for models, views, and controllers.

### 2. Database Configuration
- **Connect to Database**: Set up the connection to the chosen database (e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL).
- **Define Database Models**: Create models for user authentication and ingress data, including fields such as:
  - User ID
  - Customer Name
  - Address
  - Ingress Level
  - Frequency Range
  - Additional Notes
  - File Upload Path (if applicable)

### 3. User Authentication
- **Implement User Registration**: Create an endpoint for user registration, including validation and error handling.
- **Implement User Login**: Create an endpoint for user login, returning a token for authenticated sessions.
- **Secure Endpoints**: Use authentication middleware to protect sensitive API endpoints.

### 4. API Endpoints for Ingress Data
- **Create CRUD Endpoints**: Develop API endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting ingress records.
  - POST `/api/ingress` - Submit new ingress data.
  - GET `/api/ingress` - Retrieve all ingress records.
  - GET `/api/ingress/{id}` - Retrieve a specific ingress record.
  - PUT `/api/ingress/{id}` - Update an existing ingress record.
  - DELETE `/api/ingress/{id}` - Delete an ingress record.

### 5. File Handling
- **Implement File Upload**: Create an endpoint to handle file uploads from the frontend.
- **Store File Paths**: Save the file paths in the database for reference.

### 6. Testing the API
- **Write Unit Tests**: Develop unit tests for the API endpoints to ensure they function correctly.
- **Integration Testing**: Test the integration between the frontend and backend to verify data flow and functionality.

### 7. Documentation
- **Update README.md**: Document the progress made in Stage 3, including API endpoints and usage instructions.
- **Create STAGE_3.md**: Document the steps taken during Stage 3 for future reference.

## Conclusion
Completing these steps will establish a robust backend for the Ingress Monitoring System, enabling user authentication and data management, and setting the stage for further integration with the frontend in the next stage.
